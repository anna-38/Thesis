# Thesis
This repository contains the codes and the development of my thesis in Data Science.  
In particular, it is an analysis of the propensity score methods used to estimate the average causal effect in observational studies with multiple treatments.  
The considered study case concerns the comparison of surgical resection techniques used with cellular hepatocarcinoma (HCC).  
Even a simulation study has been constructed.  
The dataset is not provided due to privacy issues. Anyway, it belongs to the Italian register realized by the HE.RC.O.LE.S. project (https://www.hercolesgroup.eu/).
